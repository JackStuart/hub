Microsoft Power Up Program is focused on helping non-technical people transition their careers, in this case into the Power Platform area. It contains self-paced learning, guidance and mentoring from experts and free exam vouchers to take exams to certify your skills.

It is not as straight forward as other opportunities offering exam vouchers but free stuff is free stuff. The program lasts roughly 3 months and you are expected to invest around 8-10 hours a week into it by learning, attending webinars and completing challenges.

For people already skilled in Power Platform, there is an option to sign up as a volunteer and give back to the community, you can do so [here](https://powerup.microsoft.com/ChampSignUp/)
