## [Exam Study Groups](https://discord.com/channels/676990910176821270/1118446725540085801/1199713482937999420) 
**(100% off fundamental voucher)**

As part of the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program, MLSAs are able to organize Exam Study groupd for either AZ-900 or AI-900 where upon the end, participants will receive a free fundamental voucher. 

This program will require participation from participants, for example completing Microsoft Learn modules or attending study sessions with trainers. 

As a disclaimer, this is currently my first time organizing something like this so I don't have all the information and unfortunately can't promise anything. 

For the information that I know:
- Students have priority, otherwise everyone is allowed to join
- I don't decide how many vouchers get distributed, Microsoft does
- This program should repeat every 3 months and take approximately 2 months to end
- **Everyone will be required to book and take the exam**, the vouchers are monitored. I cannot stress how important this is, don't be the reason we lose yet another free voucher program
- Active participation is required
- Voucher is good for any fundamental exam

If you are interested, there will be a sign-up form here you can use to register when the Study Groups start.
