Replay vouchers allow you to have second exam attempt if you fail the first time. It is cheaper than buying 2 separete vouchers but also if you pass the first time, you can't use the second attempt for any other exam. There is also a bundle with MeasureUp practice test. 
Depending on where you are located, the bundles can be very cheap and worth the money but also really expensive.
