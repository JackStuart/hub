Microsoft offers a lot of resources to get students into the cloud, here are some opportunities that Microsoft offers.

[**Azure for Students**](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290) \- Similar to the Free Azure Account but better. If you have an email address from your school, you should be eligible for this offer. Credit card isn't needed.
You get:
- 100$ in azure credits for 12 months (renewable if you are still a student)
- Various free Azure services for 12 months
- Product Keys for various Microsoft products. To access these keys, go to [Azure](https://portal.azure.com), search **Education** in to search bar on top. In the **Education** resource, go to **Software** and just hit Claim Key on the products. I recommend copying those keys over so you don't lose them (If you get an error after claiming a lot of them, wait 24h)
:::note 
The Product Keys might not be available if your school isn't a customer of Microsoft.

[**Student exam discount**](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/student-discounts?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290) \- If you pick Student as a Job title in your certification profile and verify your status, you will be eligible for discounted Microsoft exam prices. It is 30% off for fundamental exams and 45% off for role-based exams. This discount is stackable with vouchers so you can add further 50-80% off and take the exam for a really low price.

[**University credits for certifications**](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/college-credit?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290) \- If your university allows it, you can gain credits for your certifications. There are also credits for fundamental exams which are really easy to obtain.
