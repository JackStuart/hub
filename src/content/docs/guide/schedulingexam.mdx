# Ordering & Redeeming

You can start the exam ordering process on the exam website, the URL is: aka.ms/examname so for example [https://aka.ms/sc100](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/exams/sc-100/?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290) or [https://aka.ms/az-400](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/exams/az-400/?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290) , if it doesn't work then you can find all of them [here](https://aka.ms/traincertposter).

**You can only have 2 exams scheduled at the same time.**

Then you scroll down to the "Schedule exam" section. For some exams there is also the option to take it through CertiPort, this option is mainly for students, you will want the **PearsonVue** option. 
After clicking **Schedule exam**, you will be taken to the Certification Profile that you have created before. 
After verifying the information, you will continue to the Exam Discounts page, here is the first of the 2 ways to apply the vouchers for your exam. If the voucher is associated with the email account you will see it there. Just hit the **Claim** button on the voucher to redeem it and click the **Schedule Exam** in bottom right to continue. This will take you to the PearsonVue portal.

First you need to choose how you will take the exam. The choices are:

<img title="" src="/pearsonvueexamoptions.png" alt="PearsonVue Exam Options"/>

* At a test center - you will physically have to go to the location and take the exam there (this is the best option, more on that later)
* Online using the OnVue app - you will take the exam in your home/office, no need to travel anywhere (this is not the recommended option)
* Using the Private Access Code - some training courses (usually the paid ones) end with the class taking the exam right there. You can also get the code if you have relationship with a private testing center that can schedule you individually.

After you click on one of the options, you can see more specific information. When rescheduling, you can't switch between them, you must cancel and order the exam again. This will most probably not return a voucher if you used one. You will need to contact [Certification Support](https://aka.ms/certificationsupport) if that is the case.

### For the testing center exams

* Bring government issued ID with a photo on it with you. If you are taking the exam from another country, there are special ID requirements.
* Arrive at least 15 mins early to start the check-in process (you can arrive on time or a few minutes later if you contact them ahead informing them you are running late) but if you arrive late there is a chance the exam will be revoked and cancelled. Also, it is good to arrive sooner to have a buffer in case of technical difficulties.

### For online exams

* Start the check-in process no later than 30 minutes before the exam starts. The app is a huge mess with technical issues, proctors wanting a full walkthrough of your room etc. If something breaks you will thank God for every minute you have so they don't cancel on you.

I recommend going through all of the links above to assure you are compliant with all the rules and restrictions. The online exams can be really rough on first time takers.

After all of this, now you can choose a language. I personally recommend English as the translation are sometimes weird. Also if you are not a native speaker, you can request more time here: [**English as a second language**](https://learn.microsoft.com/credentials/certifications/available-exam-accommodations-document-requirements?WT.mc_id=studentamb_165290#english-as-a-second-language). 

<img title="" src="/pearsonvueselectlanguage.png" alt="PearsonVue Select Exam Language Page"/>


After selecting a language you get to the policy and general information page. For an online option you need to agree to a bunch of stuff (you can click the text, no need to hit the boxes, saves a few seconds).

<img title="" src="/pearsonvuepolicies.png" alt="PearsonVue Exam Policies Page"/>

<img title="" src="/pearsonvuemicrosoftpolicy.png" alt="Microsoft Exam Policy Page"/>

The important information is: You can reschedule/cancel the exam only 24h before the appointment, if later you will not be able to reschedule. There is also all the information I have listed above and what you need to successfully take the exam.

If you are taking the exam online, you will also need to choose the language proctor will speak, English is also recommended here.

After agreeing to everything, then you will pick the appointment date and time. For the testing center, you will get the choice about which one to go to and see their availability. For online you can schedule it 24/7 if it isn't already full.

<img title="" src="/pearsonvueplanexamtime.png" alt="PearsonVue Plan Exam Time Page"/>

After choosing when you will take the exam, you will get to the cart, there you verify all the information. 

<img title="" src="/pearsonvuecart.png" alt="PearsonVue Exam Cart"/>

There is the option to purchase MeasureUp Practice Test there at a "discount". While MeasureUp is the objectively best (but most expensive) practice test provider, they are constantly running 30-50% sales meaning that this offer is not worth it. To check for current promotions, go to MeasureUp directly [MeasureUp Microsoft Practice Tests](https://www.measureup.com/microsoft.html#u44). If you plan to take multiple tests, it may be cheaper to get the subscription they offer [MeasureUp Subscription](https://www.measureup.com/subscription-plans-for-individuals#44)

After Proceeding to check out here is the final page where after you pay/enter voucher and go forward the exam is actually ordered. 
If you have a voucher code, you will input it under the estimated price, the button is **Add voucher or Promo Code**. After entering it you can remove it, or do another round with a different exam to see the vouchers eligibility. If you have 100% off voucher, the payment option will disappear and you can order the exam immediately.

After successfully ordering the exam, you should see the details of the appointment in the certification dashboard [https://aka.ms/certdashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard). If you don't contact [Certification Support](https://aka.ms/certificationsupport) immediately.
