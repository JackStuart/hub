# Ordering & Redeeming

You can start the exam ordering process on the exam website, the URL is: aka.ms/examname so for example [https://aka.ms/sc100](https://aka.ms/sc100) or [https://aka.ms/az-400](https://aka.ms/az-400) , if it doesn't work then you can find all of them [here](https://aka.ms/traincertposter).

**You can only have 2 exams scheduled at the same time.**

Then you scroll down to the "Schedule exam" section. After clicking "Schedule exam", you will be taken to the certification profile that you have created before. After verifying the information, you will continue to the Exam Discounts page, here is the first of the 2 ways to apply the vouchers for your exam. If the voucher is associated with the email account you will see it there. Just hit the Claim button on the voucher rectangle and click the Schedule exam in bottom right. This will take you to the PearsonVue portal.

First you need to choose how you will take the exam. The choices are:

* At a test center - you will physically have to go to the location and take the exam there (this is the best option, more on that later)
* Online using the OnVue app - you will take the exam in your home/office, no need to travel anywhere (this is not the recommended option)
* Using the Private Access Code - some training courses (usually the paid ones) end with the class taking the exam right there. You can also get a code if you have relationship with a private testing center that can schedule you individually.

After you click on one of the options, you can see more specific information. When rescheduling, you can't switch between them, you must cancel and order the exam again. This will most probably not return a voucher if you used one. You will need to contact [Certification Support](https://aka.ms/certificationsupport) if that is the case.

### For the testing center exams

* Bring government issued ID with a photo on it with you. If you are taking the exam from another country, there are special ID requirements.
* Arrive at least 15 mins early to start the check-in process (you can arrive on time or a few minutes later if you contact them ahead informing them you are running late) but if you arrive late there is a chance the exam will be revoked and cancelled. Also, it is good to arrive sooner to have a buffer in case of technical difficulties.

### For online exams

* Start the check-in process no later than 30 minutes before the exam starts. The app is a huge mess with technical issues, proctors wanting a full walkthrough of your room etc. If something breaks you will thank God for every minute you have so they don't cancel on you.

I recommend going through all of the links above to assure you are compliant with all the rules and restrictions. The online exams can be really rough on first time takers.

Then you get to the policy and general information page. For an online option you need to agree to a bunch of stuff (you can click the text, no need to hit the boxes, saves a few seconds).

The important information is: You can reschedule/cancel the exam only 24h before the appointment, if later you will not be able to reschedule. There is also all the information I have listed above and what you need to successfully take the exam.

After agreeing to everything, then you will pick the appointment date and time. For the testing center, you will get the choice about which one to go to and see their availability. For online you can schedule it 24/7 if it isn't full.

After choosing when you will take the exam, you will get to the cart, there you verify all the information. After Proceeding to check out here is the final page where after you pay/enter voucher and go forward the exam is actually ordered. If you receive voucher code, you will input it under the estimated price, the button is **Add voucher or Promo Code**. After entering it you can remove it, or do another round with a different exam to see the vouchers eligibility.

After successfully ordering the exam, you should see the details of the appointment in the certification dashboard [https://aka.ms/certdashboard](https://aka.ms/certdashboard). If you don't contact [Certification Support](https://aka.ms/certificationsupport) immediately.
