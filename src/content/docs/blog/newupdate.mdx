:::tip[Hello World!]
It's your local friendly contributor **nighthouse** here, and I'm here to announce that MSFTHub has been revamped! 
There's been a whole lot of changes, and I'm here to tell you about them.
:::

## Style & Theme

A lot of the pages have been changed, we now have a purple colored theme and a new documentation style. This includes a better sidebar
and several other minor QOL changes (e.g. broken links). Moreover the documentation has been restructured making it more organized and consistent.

## Exam Collection

![New Wiki Page](/newwiki.png)

This page contains all the exams with their respective names making it easier to find the exam you're looking for rather than 
having to go through the sidebar. This page also contains the exam codes and the respective exam names. It's an overall
nicer way to view the exams and the link should be a one stop shop for all your exam needs.

:::note
A lot of the exams are still missing information and we would love for you to contribute, you can easily do so now by clicking 
the edit button on the bottom left of the pages.

## Blog Section

You'll find the link to this page in the sidebar. This page contains all the blog posts that have been made on the site. You'll also find
it on the top right of the header. This is a good way to keep up with the latest news and updates on the site.
