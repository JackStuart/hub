<Card title="Applied Skills" icon="star"> 
Applied Skills are a new type of credential that tests your hands-on experience with Microsoft products. These credentials focus on practical tasks completed using Microsoft products. Currently, they are free, making them a great way to practice at no cost, but that may change in the future.

<Card title="Microsoft GitHub" icon="star"> 
While GitHub Labs are not free like those on Microsoft Learn, they offer comprehensive lab exercises that guide you through projects and help you become familiar with the products you'll be tested on. For Azure labs, at the end of each session, there is a self-destruct PowerShell script. Always run it when you finish to avoid additional costs.

<Card title="Microsoft Learn" icon="star"> 
Microsoft Learn sandboxes are mini-labs included in Microsoft Learn modules. They provide an easy and simple way to practice using the products you will be tested on.

<Card title="Guided Labs" icon="star"> 
Guided Labs are essentially interactive videos. They are free and easy to navigate, but the downside is that they are not live environments. It's always good to supplement these with real labs using Microsoft products.
